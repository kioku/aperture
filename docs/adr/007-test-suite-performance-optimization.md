# ADR-007: Test Suite Performance Optimization

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Aperture test suite was experiencing performance issues that significantly impacted developer productivity and CI/CD pipeline efficiency:

- **Runtime**: ~30-40 seconds for full test suite
- **Test Count**: 359 total tests (275 integration + 84 unit tests)
- **Developer Impact**: Slow feedback loops during development
- **CI Impact**: Long build times across multiple OS platforms
- **Bottlenecks Identified**:
  - 221+ binary compilation invocations via `Command::cargo_bin()`
  - Lack of test categorization for selective execution
  - Sequential test execution patterns
  - Fixed sleep delays in cache TTL tests

## Decision

We have implemented a comprehensive test suite optimization strategy addressing all identified bottlenecks:

### 1. Binary Caching Infrastructure

**Decision**: Implement shared binary path caching using `once_cell`

- **Implementation**: `tests/common/mod.rs` with `APERTURE_BIN` static
- **Impact**: Eliminates repeated binary path resolution (221+ calls → 1 cached path)
- **Pattern**: Replace `Command::cargo_bin("aperture")` with `aperture_cmd()`

### 2. Test Categorization

**Decision**: Categorize tests by execution speed and requirements

- **Categories**:
  - Unit tests: Fast, no external dependencies (`--no-default-features`)
  - Integration tests: CLI spawn + MockServer (`--features integration`)
- **Implementation**: `#![cfg(feature = "integration")]` annotations
- **Benefit**: Selective test execution for faster feedback

### 3. Time-Based Test Optimization

**Decision**: Replace fixed delays with minimal viable TTLs

- **Change**: Cache TTL tests from 3s sleep → 600ms (500ms TTL + 100ms buffer)
- **Impact**: 2.4s reduction in test execution time
- **Safety**: Maintained cache expiration test validity

### 4. Advanced Test Tooling

**Decision**: Adopt cargo-nextest for improved parallelization

- **Configuration**: `.config/nextest.toml` with optimized profiles
- **Profiles**: `default`, `ci`, `fast` with different timeout/retry settings
- **Benefits**: Better parallel execution, enhanced reporting, timeout management

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline Optimization

**Decision**: Restructure GitHub Actions for parallel execution

- **Pattern**: Split unit tests (fast feedback) from integration tests (cross-platform)
- **Optimization**: Use nextest ci profile, eliminate duplicate test runs
- **Caching**: Enhanced caching strategy for cargo-nextest installation

## Alternatives Considered

### Resource Pooling Alternative: MockServer and TempDir Pooling

- **Rejected**: Added complexity for minimal gain (<0.5s improvement)
- **Reason**: Binary caching provides 90% of the performance benefit

### Binary Alternative: Test Against Library Functions

- **Partially Adopted**: Some tests converted to unit tests
- **Limitation**: CLI integration behavior still requires binary testing

### Time Alternative: Mock Time Libraries

- **Rejected**: Added complexity outweighed benefits for simple TTL tests
- **Chosen**: Shorter real delays with adequate safety margins

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Performance**: 70% improvement (~30-40s → ~8-10s for full suite)
- **Developer Experience**: Fast unit test feedback (~0.2s for unit tests)
- **CI Efficiency**: Parallel job execution, better resource utilization
- **Maintainability**: Clear test categorization and shared utilities
- **Reliability**: Consistent test execution with timeout management

#### Performance Metrics

| Test Category | Count | Runtime | Command |
|---------------|-------|---------|---------|
| Unit Tests | 91+ | ~0.2s | `cargo test --no-default-features` |
| Integration Tests | 200+ | ~9s | `cargo test --features integration` |
| Total Suite | 373+ | ~10s | `cargo test --features integration` |

### Negative

- **Complexity**: Additional test infrastructure to maintain
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand test categories and tools
- **Dependencies**: New dependency on cargo-nextest (optional but recommended)

### Risks

- **Binary Cache Invalidation**: Cached paths may become stale after major builds
- **Test Isolation**: Shared resources could potentially cause test interference
- **Platform Differences**: Some optimizations may work better on certain platforms

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)

- [x] Created `tests/common/mod.rs` with shared utilities
- [x] Added `once_cell` dependency for caching infrastructure

### Phase 2: Test Migration (Completed)

- [x] Added `integration` feature flag and categorization
- [x] Migrated 11 integration test files to use cached binary
- [x] Replaced 221+ `Command::cargo_bin()` calls

### Phase 3: Time Optimization (Completed)

- [x] Optimized cache TTL tests (reduced sleep delays)

### Phase 4: Tooling & CI (Completed)

- [x] Added cargo-nextest configuration with profiles
- [x] Created `scripts/test-fast.sh` for easy adoption
- [x] Optimized GitHub Actions workflow

### Phase 5: Documentation (Completed)

- [x] Created `TESTING.md` with comprehensive usage guide
- [x] Added `.cargo/config.toml` with test aliases
- [x] Documented this ADR

## Monitoring

- **Baseline**: Full test suite ~30-40 seconds (before optimization)
- **Target**: <15 seconds (achieved: ~8-10s for full suite)
- **Unit Tests**: ~0.2 seconds (91+ tests)
- **Integration Tests**: ~9 seconds (200+ tests)

## Rollback Plan

If optimizations cause issues:

1. **Binary Cache Issues**: Remove `common` module usage, revert to `Command::cargo_bin()`
2. **Test Issues**: Revert to original test structure
3. **Timing Issues**: Revert cache TTL tests to original 2-3 second delays
4. **CI Issues**: Revert GitHub Actions to original single-job approach
